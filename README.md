A friendly competition to make a fun game in js!

## What? Why?
Because we can! Small friendly competitions are a great way to push yourself to learn new things in a non-stessful manner.

## Requirements
All games should meet the requirements on this list.
- [ ] Defined stack. You must detail what technologies you use.
- [ ] Must be made with JavaScript and HTML5 based
  - Allowed Client Game Engines:
  -  [ ] Vanilla js: if you are crazy enough to do it, by all means.
  -  [ ] [createjs](http://createjs.com/) 
  *  [ ] [phaser](http://phaser.io/) (recommended)
  *  [ ] [pixi](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js)
  *  [ ] [quintus](http://www.html5quintus.com/)
  *  [ ] [kiwi](http://www.kiwijs.org/)

- [ ] Old school feel (e.g. pacman, space invaders, asteroids, pong, tetris), though it can be original or a clone
- [ ] Link to an active playable demo
- [ ] Multiplayer aspect (doesn't necessarily have to be isomorphic)
- [ ] Sockets (for realtime)
- [ ] Authenticated users - gameplay optional
  - To expand on this, you can play without signing in, but you should be able to if you want. 
- **Submission date is June 24, 2016. Submit with PR**
